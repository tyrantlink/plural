        If you\'re coming from PluralKit or Tupperbox, start with the {cmd_ref[import]} command to use the proxies you already have.

        Otherwise, you can start by creating a new group with {cmd_ref[group new]},
          - If you don\'t create a group, a group named "default" will be created for you when you create a member.

        Create a new member with {cmd_ref[member new]}
          - all members *must* be a part of a group, specify in the {cmd_ref[member new]} command, or leave it blank to use the default group.

        Add some proxy tags with {cmd_ref[member tags add]}.

        Then, you can start proxying by using your set tags in a message, or enabling the autoproxy with {cmd_ref[autoproxy]}.

        Nearly everything is configurable via {cmd_ref[config]}, including both user and server settings.

        That\'s all the basics, otherwise, simply type `/` and see what commands are available, or check out the [wiki](https://{env.domain}) for more info.

        Userproxies are proxy members attached to a real Discord Bot, giving them the ability to be used in DMs, Group DMs, and servers without /plu/ral. They can also have bios and banner images right in their pop out.

        This feature is advanced and requires a lot of setup, if you want to use it, [follow the instructions on the wiki](<https://{env.domain}/guide/userproxies#creating-a-userproxy>).

        If you have a large number of members, you don't have to create a userproxy for each one, just the most frequently used, then you can use the {{cmd_ref[say]}} command to send messages as any member.

        The {{cmd_ref[say]}} responds with an embed, and does not support many of the features of a normal message, basically just text. Userproxies should always be used if you're willing to go through the setup.

        **Note: it is currently not possible to autoproxy with userproxies**, you must use the command every time.
        This may change in the future through client modding.

        If you want to support the project, you can donate to help with server costs, and development.

        Benefits:
        - Less money in your bank account
        - ðŸŒŸ/plu/ral supporterðŸŒŸ text on your proxy info page
        - The supporter role in [the support server](https://discord.gg/4mteVXBDW7)

        I don't plan on charging for features, and donation is permanent, even if you only donate $1, one time, you will keep your supporter status forever.

        I *may* add an increased avatar limit as a benefit in the future, since that has a direct cost to me
        (see {cmd_ref[stats]} for current usage/limit)

        Feel free to donate through whichever source you prefer, all donations are appreciated. Only Patreon and Discord rewards are automatic, the others require manual verification.
