# Donations

If you like the bot and find it useful, consider supporting the development. I am a single developer, this takes all of my free time and servers are expensive. You don't have to donate, but it is greatly appreciated.

#### Benefits
- The supporter role in the [support server](https://discord.gg/4mteVXBDW7)
- Recognition when someone uses `/plu/ral proxy info` command on one of your messages
- Probably more at some point, but I will never charge for features unless they have a direct cost to me. (e.g. avatar limits)

Once you donate, you'll keep the supporter status forever, even if it's just a one-time donation or you cancel a subscription.

### Donation Methods
The only completely automatic methods are Patreon and Discord, to claim your benefits with any other method, you'll need to send the developer a DM with the platform you donated on and your username on that platform.

Fees listed are fees that I pay, not fees that you pay, so if your goal is to maximize the amount of money that supports the project, you should choose a method with a lower fee. However your convenience is the highest priority, so choose whichever method you prefer.
