# Donations

If you like the bot and find it useful, consider supporting the development. I am a single developer, this takes all of my free time and servers are expensive. You don't have to donate, but it is greatly appreciated.

#### Benefits
- The supporter role in the [support server](https://discord.gg/4mteVXBDW7)
- Stars next to your name when someone uses the `/plu/ral proxy info` command on one of your messages
- Probably more at some point, but I will never charge for features unless they have a direct cost to me.

Once you donate, you'll keep the supporter role forever, even if it's just a one-time donation or you cancel a subscription.

### Donation Methods
Methods are listed in order of my preference, based on how much of a cut the platform takes, but ultimately it's up to you.

if you have another method you'd like to use, let me know in the development server and i'll see what i can do.
