# Server Config

This page is intended for server moderators

All config, for users, userproxies, and servers is managed via the `/config` command.

This page covers the Server Config category.
For user and userproxy config, see [User and Userproxy Config](/guide/config.md)

All config options have built-in descriptions when using the command, so this page will only include additional information. The descriptions in the bot are always the most up-to-date.
