## Differences

/plu/ral has a few differences from PluralKit and Tupperbox, mostly in usage.

All /plu/ral commands are Discord slash commands, so you can type `/` in a channel with /plu/ral in it, and select /plu/ral's icon on the left to see all available commands.

This comes with the benefit of built-in descriptions and exact option types for every command, so you don't need to reference documentation to know how to use a command.

For example, members, groups, and proxy tags are all selected with autocomplete, so you can simply start typing and see available options.

### Differences from PluralKit
- To link accounts (`pk;link`), see [Using Multiple Accounts](/guide/multiple-accounts.md)
- There is no support for legacy moderation bots, as /plu/ral prioritizes speed. Discord AutoMod is more effective and can act before any bot can.
- When importing, the member display name is preferred, as /plu/ral does not have display names, and member names are set to what should be displayed.
