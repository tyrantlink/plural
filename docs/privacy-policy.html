    <h1>Privacy Policy for /plu/ral</h1>

    <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
    <p>
        /plu/ral only collects data that users explicitly provide using interactions with the bot, as well as the message IDs of any proxied messages.
        The only exception is the UserProxy bot /proxy "queue for reply" option, which stores message content and attachment urls until the reply command is used, or five minutes have passed, whichever is shorter.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Use of Data</h2>
    <p>The data collected is used strictly for bot functionality, such as proxying messages.</p>

    <h2>3. Open Source</h2>
    <p>Since /plu/ral is open source, the source code is freely available for review under the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html" target="_blank">AGPL license</a>. Users can see exactly how the bot operates and how data is handled. The source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/tyrantlink/plural" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>

    <h2>4. User Control and Data Deletion</h2>
    <p>Users have full control over their data and can delete all stored data using the /delete_all_data command.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>No data is shared with third parties, except as required by law.</p>

    <h2>6. Data Storage</h2>
    <p>Data is stored securely and is accessible only to the developers of /plu/ral.</p>

    <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>You have the right to request the deletion of all your data by using the /delete_all_data command.</p>
